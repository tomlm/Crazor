# Crazor
**Crazor** is a library which marries **Razor Templating** with **Adaptive Cards** to create a super productive 
coding environment focused 100% on building the micro card based applications.

All of the bot logic is implemented for you, all you do is make templates bound to your data and write
the code behind.  Really. 

If you know ASP.NET then Crazor will feel crazy familiar and powerful to you.

This package contains project templates for Crazor:

* **Crazor App Server**/**crazorserver**- Project template for a crazor application server using Crazor.Blazor
