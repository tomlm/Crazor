      <TextBlock Wrap="true">The left column has a very, very long text which makes it very tall. Because it is tall, the right column is also very tall. The right column contains two TextBlocks; one is displaying at the top of the column, while the other one is displayed at the bottom. That is achieved by setting the first TextBlock's **height** property to **stretch**.</TextBlock>
