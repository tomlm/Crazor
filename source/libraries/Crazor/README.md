# Crazor
**Crazor** is a library which marries Razor with Adaptive Cards to create a super productive 
coding environment focused 100% on building the card.

All of the bot logic is implemented for you, all you do is make templates bound to your data and write
the code behind.  Really. (See https://opcardbot.azurewebsites.net/ for samples in the cloud)
